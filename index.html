    <h1 class="space-top-6 space-6 fade-in two">👋🏽 — I'm <span class="theme">Varun</span>.</h1>

    <p class="space-3 fade-in three">I'm a compassionate technologist (product management & engineering) living in NYC. Previously I've worked at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/work">Airbnb</a> and Ribbon, and consulted with Malala Fund & Jumprope. I've also taught in several contexts, including as a TA back in undergrad and at General Assembly's flagship campus in Lower Manhattan.</p>

    <p class="space-3 fade-in five">I enjoy camping, playing the guitar, cooking for friends, staying active at my local YMCA, and exploring this amazing city. I appreciate simple, high quality things and attempt to surround myself with thoughtful, driven, & fundamentally kind people.</p>
