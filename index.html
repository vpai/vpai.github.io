  <p class="space-6">Hi, I'm <b>Varun</b>.</p>

  <p class="space-6">I <span class="blue"><b>design and code</b></span> for a living. Most recently I worked on Airbnb in San Francisco as a software engineer and product manager, and moved to
  New York in Fall 2017 for a fresh start.</p>

  <p>Reach me at first name dot last name then 12 at gmail dot com.</p>

  <p>
    I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at U.C Berkeley. Since then, I've:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Built out <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/work" target="_blank">Airbnb for Business</a>.</li>
    <li>Taught web development at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/varun-pai/15137" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>.</li>
    <li>Created <a href="https://www.dumpling.io/" target="_blank">The Dumpling Project</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I enjoy reading, limit my consumption of news, and don't do social media.

  <p>
    The following things help me find balance:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Playing the guitar.</li>
    <li>Cooking meals for myself and loved ones.</li>
    <li>Family and friends.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These things also make me happy: Ellen, chai, outerwear, <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money" target="_blank">Planet Money</a>, and group hugs.

  <h3 class="space-7"><b><u>body</u></b></h3>

  <p>
    I keep my body in shape:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>to improve my mood and thinking.</li>
    <li>because it's the only body I have.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I regularly run, hike, cycle, swim, dive, and lift weights. In 2016 I cycled across the US. I also enjoy yoga and am vegetarian.
