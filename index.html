    I'm <b>Varun</b>, an Indian-American "millenial" based in <span class="yellow"><b>New York City</b></span>.
  </p>

  <p class="space-6">
    I <span class="blue"><b>design and code</b></span> for a living. Currently I’m in the midst of some professional exploration, during which I’m searching for like-minded engineers and designers to connect and collaborate with.

  <p class="space-6">
    I love the creative process and making things.

    I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at U.C Berkeley. Since then, I’ve:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Built out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/work">Airbnb for Business</a>.</li>
    <li>Taught web development at <a target="_blank" href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/varun-pai/15137">General Assembly.</a></li>
    <li>Created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dumpling.io/">The Dumpling Project</a>.</li>

    The following things help me find balance:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>playing the guitar.</li>
    <li>cooking for myself and loved ones.</li>
    <li>friends and family.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These things also make me happy: Ellen, chai, outerwear, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money">Planet Money</a>, & group hugs.</p>

  <h3 class="space-7"><b><u>body</u></b></h3>

  <p>
    I keep my body in shape:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>to improve my mood and thinking.</li>
    <li>to look good naked.</li>
    <li>because it's the only body I have.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I regularly run, cycle, dive, and hike. In 2016 I cycled across the US. I also enjoy yoga, and am vegetarian.
