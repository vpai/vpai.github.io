    <h1 class="space-top-6 space-6 fade-in two">👋🏽 — I'm <span class="theme">Varun</span>.</h1>

    <p class="space-3 fade-in three">I'm a compassionate Mumbai-born technologist based in NYC. My skills span business and software development. I've shipped products at <a class="underline" href="https://www.airbnb.com/work" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> & <a class="underline" href="https://www.ribbonhome.com/" target="_blank">Ribbon</a>, and consulted with <a class="underline" href="https://www.malala.org/" target="_blank">Malala Fund</a> & <a class="underline" href="https://www.jumprope.com/" target="_blank">Jumprope</a>. I've also taught in several contexts, including as a TA at my alma mater Berkeley and at General Assembly's flagship campus in Manhattan. I'm better than most at: being optimistic, overthinking, & making people feel special.</p>

    <p class="space-3 fade-in four">I enjoy camping, playing the guitar, cooking for friends, staying active at my YMCA, and exploring New York's nooks and crannies. I value simple, high quality things and surround myself with thoughtful, driven, & fundamentally kind people.</p>

    <p class="fade-in five">Welcome to my space on the internet.</p>
