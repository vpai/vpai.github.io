Educated was fantastic, and a great choice to start a new year of reading. It's the memoir of a still-very-young (32) and ultra talented writer Tara Westover who takes readers through her childhood within a fundamentalist Mormon family living in rural Idaho, and her eventual pursuit of a higher education. It's a story of so many things: of the often difficult balance between family expectations and personal happiness (who can't relate to that?), realization of self worth, the power of critical thinking, grit and determination, and of the widening urban / rural gap that exists in the US.

Despite her father's dictatorial influence over the family, her mother's deep obedience and adherence to gender roles, and the clamp of her brother Shawn's abuse, Tara resists her destiny of becoming a homemaker and transcends life at Buck's Peak (the mountain next to which the Westover's live) to study at BYU and ultimately at Cambridge where she completes her PhD. A quote from the initial lines of the book summarizes just how extreme the Westover household is when Tara is just 7:

<blockquote>Dad worries that the Government will force us to go but it can't, because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have a birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom. When I am nine, I will be issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth, but at this moment, according to the state of Idaho and the federal government, I don't exist.</blockquote>

In Part 1, Tara tells stories of her youth within this context, including two car crashes, a violent horse incident, a harrowing motorcycle accident, and her Mom's rise as an illegal midwife. The anecdonates shine light on a world where independent thought is not valued and indoctrination is the norm (think North Korea). Tara and her brothers are treated like slaves by their father, who employs them in his scrap metal business and discourages them from attending school in the nearby town. His allegiance to the Mormon faith trumps all, even the safety of his children, believing that even near death experiences are God's will:

<blockquote>“We had been bruised and gashed and concussed, had our legs set on fire and out heads cut open. We had lived in a state of alert, a kind of constant terror, our brains flooding with cortisol because we knew that any of those things might happen at any moment. Because Dad always put faith before safety.”</blockquote>

Part 2 of the book details Tara's crossover into the modern world, starting at BYU after self studying for and scraping through the ACT. The most visceral moment from her time there is a moment she describes asking about the meaning of the word "Holocaust" in front of an entire lecture hall. Her grit and some luck lead her to a supportive professor, the start of a chain of individuals who believe in Tara for the first time ever. She travels to Cambridge on a prestigious scholarship, widening her world view, yet maintains her affinity to Buck's Peak, where she dangerously (physically and mentally) continues to visit during her breaks.

Ultimately, Tara estranges both her parents and most of her family. She gains agency of her voice, power, choices, self worth, and the control she has over the narrative she tells herself.

This book was an eye opener, an account so foreign to my personal experience that it was hard to believe this happened so close to where I grew up in California. It got me thinking of similar tensions of family and self, of course to a much lesser extreme. We don't get to pick our families, we make them work and they take work just like all relationships take work. We rarely know what happens behind closed doors of these units, but when we realize how little we know about people.

<blockquote>It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you, I had written in my journal. But Shawn had more power over me than I could possibly have imagined. He had defined me to myself, and there’s no greater power than that.</blockquote>

By the end, Tara's attachment to her home and her father is anything but rational — it's purely emotional. She knows home is bad for her but she keeps going back. And that a trap that I've definitely felt before. I'm a believer that happiness is a choice, and that negative emotions towards others are a waste of energy. Certainly for Tara, there came a point where her beliefs were adult enough to be real and valid, no matter who was on the other side.

Tara Westover is an unbelievably talented writer, I couldn't believe this was her first book. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone. Shipped my mom a copy!
