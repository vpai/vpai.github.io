Visiting India is always a treat. While growing up, we would usually go once in three or four years. It had to be during summer because of the school year, and because I was so young I had little control over the schedule. As a result, all trips would involve a predictable string of visits to relatives' homes in Mumbai, Pune, and Kerala (which were fun in their own way!).

Over the past few years, I've had the chance to visit the Motherland on my own terms. With a little disposable income under my belt, India feels like a new place. After quitting my job a couple months ago, I decided I would take a two week trip there to meet my mom and sister who were going to be there to do some wedding shopping for my sister's upcoming wedding.

Mumbai was my home base, and Varanasi (a.k.a Banaras) as a small side trip. And it was fantastic. No thinking about work, lots of eating, a few events to celebrate, hanging with my 21 year old cousin, reading, and a few new friends.

April is an excellent time to visit as it is the beginning of the mango season (and before the monsoon season)! According to my uncle, the famed [Alphonso mango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_(mango)) is not the king as is widely believed. Apparently the rise of Alphonsos was a marketing ruse led by the Tata group and the affluent Parsi community. Dasheri and banganpalli are in his opinion better. But to this American, they were all absolutely fantastic.

A few more highlights from this trip in listicle format:

- RAP (random acts of pyaar), a new cultural phenomenon developed by my cousin Ananya and I, soon to be sweeping Mumbai and the rest of the country.
- Ghar ka khanna! The amazing dahi to the homemade fluffy chapattis to all the wonderful dals and khadhis and sabjis.
- Greeting Doug at the door via our rendition of "[Saajanji Ghar Aaye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkt2U_C394)"
- IPL! The Indian Premiere League (cricket). Shanta Bappama, Arvind Appappa, and I would sit and watch matches on most evenings, cheering on the Mumbai Indians.
- Junk food tour in Infiniti Mall — McDonalds, momos, and FRANKIES!
- A drive to South Bombay and Marine drive via the Bandra—Worli sea link.
- Talking politics, stories, education, infrastructure, personality types, and more at the dinner table.
- Accompanying Ananya to get her first tatoo of a Danish word across her forearm.
- Trying on a bunch of fancy Indian clothes.
- Weightlifting with my own personal trainer!
- Exploring Varanasi with Brandon, Sacha, and company from the hostel we stayed at. I loved the little alleys of the city and morning views of the Ganga from the roof.
