Tomorrow morning, after 23 years of living in the Bay Area, I'm taking a one way from SF to NYC (!!!)

<!--more-->

Of chief importance on the eve of this life event are the weights of my 2 enormous checked in bags. I am envisioning major airport struggles in the AM. Essentials I'm taking include: clothes, toiletries, shoes, a magic bullet with an extra mug, an alarm clock, an iron, a large Indian flag, all my camping gear, some books, and a foam roller. Though honestly space is tight and it's not looking so good for the foam roller right now. Might be a Thanksgiving bring-back item (sorry quads).

In 1991 I was born in [Thane, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thane,+Maharashtra,+India/@19.2135562,72.9314199,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3be7b8fcfe76fd59:0xcf367d85f7c50283!8m2!3d19.2183307!4d72.9780897), a small suburb of Mumbai. My parents moved to Sunnyvale in '93, then Cupertino where I attended K-12, after which
I spent 4 years studying in Berkeley and another 4 years working in San Francisco. That's hella Bay! Which is all to say it's no surprise that in 2017 I am a hyper-liberal software engineer with astigmatism and modest dating experience.

There is no shortage of reasons why the Bay Area is an absolutely incredible place, but the thing is, I'm beyond sure that if I was still here in 5 years I would regret it. So a big part of this move is avoiding future regret and starting life somewhere new. I don't want to tell my kids one day that I stayed here and didn't experience more of the world at a time when it was easier than ever, when I possessed valuable economic skills, street smarts, and confidence.

So in February I quit a very stable, very comfortable job, and since have been traveling, attending friends' weddings, working on projects, working on my jumpshot, taking it easy, and most recently helping plan my own sister's wedding (a separate post for that). And tomorrow, a brand new chapter opens.

Why NYC? Some people ask. Why not NYC? I think. It's up there among the world's greatest cities, where one can encounter people from all walks of life and from all corners of the world in a single subway car. The art, the size, the speed, and the grandeur all excite me.

My hopes/dreams/goals in The Big Apple include becoming an entertainer on the side (guitar), escaping the 9-5 and working for myself, trying my hand at bartending, consistently creating, finding 5 new friends that I actively love and that actively love me back, being excited about life each and every day, learning Japanese, and letting loose.

Cheers to myself for this new life transition. No doubt it will be unsexy at first seeing as I have no job and no apartment. But hey, that'll be part of the challenge and the fun. Oh, I also have to buy a peacoat ASAP. Where does one buy that?
