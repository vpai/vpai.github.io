It’s 8:25 AM on the morning of December 17th, 2015. I’m at home getting ready for work when I receive the following email from my friend Bharath:

It’s an insane flight deal to Norway via a subscription to his friend Scott’s [cheap flight mailing list](https://scottscheapflights.com/). Thing is, these tickets are for November 2016, almost a full year in the future. Though it's an exciting prospect, I’m hesitant. A year out is a long time, what if something else important comes up? Norway also isn't exactly the cheapest destination. A few days later, things have changed:

For a year the tickets sit in our inboxes, and most of 2016 passes. Among other adventures I spend 3 months living in Singapore and cycle across the US during the summer.

September rolls around and we realize that we need to plan this thing. First things first, we get together one evening over dinner and create an outline of our travel goals and rough itinerary. Bharath draws inspiration from the Earth Porn [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/search?q=norway). Soon another friend Amanda is looped into the plans, and we agree to meet her halfway through the trip in the Artic Circle. In all, we decide to tackle 4 regions over 2 weeks: Oslo, Bergen (via Flåm), Tromsō, and the Lofoten Islands.

In no, time it’s late October and we’re off.

# Oslo

We land in Oslo on a frigid Monday evening. It’s as cold as expected, and the rain is coming down hard. The airport is a ways out of the city (like Narita/Tokyo) but the NSB train to Oslo Central Station is easy to board and takes just 20 minutes. A pro-tip for anyone visiting is to avoid the Flytoget (express train) which gets you to the city 3 minutes faster than the NSB but is twice the price (160 NOK as compared to 82 NOK). Luckily Bharath has global data on his phone, which makes these sorts of details a whole lot easier to manage throughout the trip.

From the central station we make our way to [our Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14682119) just a few minutes away. Our host Magne welcomes us with a fresh pot of coffee made using a coffee maker that’s built into his granite kitchen top. It's one of several accents in his chic, modern, and clean space. Despite impending jetlag, we venture out into the city that night, grabbing a bite then making our way to the Opera house on the water. Along the way we brainstorm possible alternate identities we could adopt on this trip — we land on being a pair of independent filmmakers to whoever asks. Heck, it's better sounding than two guys in tech. We try and get a good night’s sleep in, as we’re set to head off to Bergen the next morning.

The next AM is an early one. We reach the train station by 7:30 and soak in the Norweigan sunlight. Before we board the train, I buy a few bun-like pastries as snacks from a shop inside
the station. They are called [boller](https://food52.com/blog/7359-mormor-s-boller), and are little puffs of heaven. Each of the three varieties available at this shop — raisin, chocolate chip, and plain — is warm, perfectly sweetened, and contains a dash of cardomom for a little
added depth. Not to mention super cheap!

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/boller.png" caption="Raisin boller." %}

The train journey to Bergen is among the most beautful train rides I’ve ever been on. The color pallette is gorgeous: yellows, dark greens, and blacks line the horizon along with low hanging fog. The landscapes change quickly, and before we know it we’ve ascended into the mountains. Suddently snow is everywhere, and the reflections of the backdrop on the foreground lakes are stunning.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/train.png" caption="View from the Oslo-Bergen line." %}

The train stops abruptly in Ål, and we are told to offboard. We’re being moved to buses for the rest of the journey, apparently due a “power outage” but we’re pretty certain it’s a worker's strike. We take the bus the rest of the way to Flåm.

# Flåm

Flåm is a charming village at the end of Aurlandsfjord (a fjord is a "long, narrow, deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs"). Out of handful of towns we could have stopped at on the Oslo-Bergen line (via [Norway in a Nutshell](https://www.norwaynutshell.com/)), we chose Flåm because we had read good things about hiking in the area.

The [hostel](https://www.hihostels.com/hostels/Flåm) in town is both clean and welcoming. To our delight they have a few apple trees around the property and we grab some ripe apples off the ground as snacks for later. A short while after settling in,
we hike up the [Brekkefossen waterfall trail](http://seattlebackpackersmagazine.com/norways-brekkefossen-waterfall-trail/), which is steep but well worth it. It takes us a couple hours round trip, and I scarf down the crisp apple I brought along at the top, which I wash in the cold waterfall.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/flam.png" caption="View down on Flåm along the Brekkefossen hike." %}

We return to our rooms to find our flatmates setting up their beds. They are starving and so are we, so we all head to Flåm's celebrated [Viking restaurant/brewery](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g230076-d3512984-Reviews-Aegir_Brewery_Pub-Flam_Aurland_Municipality_Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_Norway.html). While waiting for a table, we grab beers and teach our new friends [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup), one of our favorite games that we had brought along. After a filling Viking supper, we head home and crash hard from exhaustion.

The next morning we grab a couple egg sandwiches from the local mart (which hit the spot) and do a morning hike to the nearby abandoned village of Otternes. Eating out is prohibitively expensive in Norway, and we quickly learn that buying groceries is the way to go.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/otternes.png" caption="Panorama from Otternes." %}

At 4 PM we board our boat, set to take us through the fjords to Gundvangen, where we will board a train the rest of the way to Bergen. The boat journey lasts a couple hours, though at this point I am so tired that I nap through
most of the journey. We are still jetlagged and have spent the past two nights working our respective jobs during
US work hours.

That night we land in Norway's second biggest city, Bergen.

# Bergen

In Bergen [we stay with a lovely family](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14532794) of four in Nordnes, the peninsula in the center of the city. Bergen as a whole is extremely walkable, and our Airbnb serves as a good base for our treks around the city across the three days we have. One of the first things we do is buy groceries at the local Kiwi supermarket. Eggs, fruit, and yogurt make a cheap breakfast for the next few mornings.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/breakfast.png" caption="Eating breakfast before setting out for the day in Bergen." %}

One of the first things we had read about in Bergen was the Fløibanen funicular, a cable car that takes you up Mt. Floyen, one of 7 mountains surrounding Bergen. We wake up the next morning and take the funicular up, rewarded with a panoramic view of the city:

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/bergen_view.png" caption="View atop Mt. Floyen."  %}

We get excited by the seemingly endless network of trails at the top of the mountain. We choose to hike up to Rundamanen peak, a 6 km round trip. At times the hike is spooky — no souls around and fog in all directions.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/rundamanen.png" caption="View from Rundamanen." %}

On the way down we discover a ropes course! It's a wet day, and nobody is around, so Bharath and I play on this thing like we're 5. There's a slide, various obstacles, and even a zipline. Afterwards we learn from some fellow hikers that the course is less than a week old! Instead of taking the funicular down, we walk it, stopping by an excellent [coffee shop](http://nordiccoffeeculture.com/det-lille-kaffekompaniet-bergen/) and [bakery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Godt+Br%C3%B8d+Fl%C3%B8yen/@60.3960329,5.3258012,17.06z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3e77e9f3a3d6fe31!8m2!3d60.3961457!4d5.3282102) in the rain.

That evening is the eve of Bharath's birthday and we make it a point to explore the
local music scene. Finding events, however, can be a challenge. Facebook turn out to be a great discovery tool for small local gatherings. We end up at Dr. Weisener, a local pub where
a [visiting band is playing](https://www.facebook.com/events/685061201670070/) in an intimate setting. This turns out to be an amazing band — we learn that the elderly group gets together once a year and picks a country to tour in. They then show up and play whatever gigs they can get in exchange for free food and beer. They've been doing this for over 20 years now.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/band.png" caption="Us with The Reunion Band." %}

How freaking cool. This night at Dr. Weisener they play everything from Irish folk music to songs about Trump to sappy love tunes. We take a look at the beer list and there's a local beer called Rundamanen! Of course we each get one.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/beer.png" caption="Beer!" %}

Our final full day in Bergen is Bharath's birthday. I make Bharath breakfast and we walk around Nordnes during the AM. After we head to the town center, where a very peculiar thing happens.

We're sitting on a bench eating a snack when all of a sudden a man behind starts panicking. He's East Asian,
and it becomes clear that he doesn't speak English well. We make out that a bag of his has just been stolen.
He had put the bag down behind him and while taking a selfie, someone had swooped in and made
off with it. The kicker: because the bag was behind him, he had captured the thief in his photo!
The robber is a middle aged woman with blonde hair.

We know we have limited time so we walk in the direction we think the thief has gone. A few minutes
go by and the victim decides to report the crime to the police, so we split up. Time is ticking. We are close to giving up, when, in the corner of my eye, I see the woman! Bharath and I walk torwards her, and oddly, she sees us coming and approaches us.

The woman doesn't know English either. She hands us the bag, claiming via gestures that she had found it
and was looking to return it (she tries to position herself as a hero). At this point she is also with a
man, and we know something shady is up. Our hunch was that they had probably taken valuables out of the bag and now were returning the rest for whatever reason. I signal for them to stay where they are while we find the victim, but in a flash they are gone.

The victim comes back to the site of the crime and we hand him his bag. Surprisingly, there is nothing valuable missing. Overall a really weird encounter. The man thanks us profusely and we say our goodbyes.

That afternoon we do some shopping at Bryggen, one of Bergen's most famous sights. While exploring all the
little nooks around the buildings, we make two new friends Lise and Anne, both middle aged woman with lively
personalities. Lise lives about an hour outside of Bergen and is showing Anne around. We instantly hit it off
and Lise even invites us to stay with her the next time we are in Bergen.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/bergen_walking.png" caption="A colorful scene in Bergen." %}

We spend the tail end of the day exploring the area near Bergen's main fountain, with the highlight being a
small hole-in-the-wall handmade guitar shop. We stop and chat with Victor, the owner, who mentions that each guitar takes him about a month to make. The results are incredible works of art. Check out his work [here](http://guitarrasmanzanera.com/).

That evening, despite ambitions of checking out [Hulen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hulen+i+Bergen/@60.3847441,5.3234329,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1124bc99cb956738!8m2!3d60.3847592!4d5.3253651) (a concert venue inside
a cave), we nap and don't wake up until late at night. It's okay. Hey, we were heroes for a day.

# Tromso & The Northern Lights

Our next destination is Tromsō, a small city in the Artic
Circle that during the 19th century was revered as the "Paris of the North". The major draw of coming up
this far north is to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. We know that 2016 is near the peak
of a 10 year solar cycle where the lights are at their strongest.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/plane.png" caption="Small plane to Tromsō." %}

Upon arrival at the airport we meet up with Amanda, drop off our bags at the hostel, and walk over
Tromsō's main bridge to see the Artic Cathedral (which I would probably skip seeing in retrospect).
In order to maximize our chances of seeing the lights, we book a tour through our hostel that
night.

In the evening we join our tour guide Bert and few others from the [hostel](http://www.citycampguesthouse.com/) and drive out roughly an hour outside of town to Sommarøy. We set up shop on a hill by the coast underneath a hole in the cloud coverage. Bert has brought hot chocolate and sets up a fire with marshmallows that warms an
otherwise freezing night.

The lights come out slowly, then rapidly pick up. We see greens, reds, and even purples (the second
two being rarer colors). There are moments when lights seem to dance in the sky. The show lasts a few
hours, and we feel fortunate to bear witness.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/northern_lights.png" caption="Shot of the Northern Lights." %}

We get back late, around 2 in the morning. It's the last night of a huge music festival in town featuring
some of Norway's best DJs, and though the festival itself is winding down, the afterparties are just
getting going. Through the hostel we hear of a particular afterparty that's set to take place in a World
War II bunker, but have no further details. After overcoming stay-at-home inertia, we wander around the small town looking for this bunker. We meet someone who knows where it is and after a slippery walk across town, we make it.

It's 3 AM and literally no one is at this bunker. We give it 30 minutes. If nobody arrives by 3:30, we tell
ourselves, we're out. Eventually a man walks up, turns out he's the bouncer. We start chatting him up as
other people start arriving and crowding near the entrance. We learn that this is an invite only thing and it's probably going to be difficult to get in. Luckily we make friends with more people in line, and because we've met the bouncer, he lets us Americans in.

The party is amazing — great music, really cool venue, and free beers (unheard of in Norway). Some of
Norway's best musicians are there, and we dance till 6 AM.

The next day is a wash. We get up late eat, and because the days are relatively short, it's dark by
the time we've finished our late lunch. We settle inside a cafe with some games and learn a new board game
called ["Ned Kelly"](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28881/game-ned-kelly).

Our final morning in Tromsō we spend doing a morning hike up the Fløya with two Swedish
women who are also making their way up the snowy terrain. The views overlooking Tromsō and the surrounding
region are killer. We take the Fløya down and chill at [our favorite cafe in town](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ris%C3%B8+mat+%26+kaffebar/@69.6479581,18.9558728,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x973425b63ed92205?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCzI6IrIbRAhVIyVQKHSRPAAwQ_BIIeTAK) before heading to our last destination of the trip, the Lofoten Islands.

# Lofoten Islands

The Lofoten Islands make up an archipelago a few hundred miles southwest of Tromsō. If there was one
place we felt we needed to hit above all else it was here. We budgeted 3 full days on the islands — time
meant to be spent outside hiking, exploring, and perhaps catching more of the aurora.

Our go-to resource when researching the islands was [68 North](http://www.68north.com/), a really well
done blog by a local photographer Cody. After reading through a few of his posts we realized that we
would need to rent a car to get across the islands, and moreover that instead of renting from the big
named companies it was easy and cheaper to rent from local car shops that didn't have as much of an
internet presence. After some Google-fu I came across [this](http://lofotenutleiebiler.com/) shop, and
after a quick call reserved an old Mercedes sedan on the cheap. We arrived at Leknes (the local airport)
late that evening and the Benz was waiting for us just outside the door.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/benz.png" caption="Our old but functional ride around the Lofoten Islands." %}

It has at least 10 flashing errors on the dashboard, but it runs so that was all that mattered.
We stop at a grocery shop and picked up tons of food for the next few days — in Lofoten we would
cook over 7 meals in our Airbnb.

[Our rorbu](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13095307) is fantastic. A rorbu is a traditional red fishing hut, and many of them in the Lofoten
Islands are restored and quite modern. The one we stay in is ultra clean, cozy, and has a deck
directly overlooking a beautiful inlet.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/rorbu.png" caption="View from the deck outside our rorbu." %}

Each day in Lofoten is organized as follows: wake up, cook/eat breakfast at home, set out as early
as possible and do a solid day hike, come home and relax for a bit, cook dinner, maybe watch some
TV, try and see the Northern Lights, sleep, and repeat.

On day 1 Bharath and I do a coastal hike from Njusford to Nesland. The hiking conditions are far from
ideal because of the rain, but we are able to plow through. Once we get past the muddy beginning, the
terrain varies from rock outcroppings to dense trees to thin paths over streams. There is a cool
ladder we have to ascend, much like the Matt Davis trail in Marin. That night we cook ravioli and watch the Northern Lights from our rorbu. The rorbu has a loft (Bharath's room) and we find the most ideal viewing setup:
we lay face up on Bharath's bed underneath the blankets, poke our heads outside the room's two tiny windows,
and watch the lights while our bodies are bundled up inside.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/cooking.png" caption="Another breakfast." %}

Day 2 we hike up to the Ryten summit, my favorite hike of them all. We pack egg salad sandwiches (see a theme?)
for lunch. The view from the top is absolutely phenomenal. We are also the only ones on the mountain. On the way down there is a particular view that reminds us of Catan: we spot ore, wheat, a city, and a port all in the same frame! That night dinner is rice and teriyaki vegetables. Bharath and I stay up late and watch the Cubs win the World Series in Game 7.

{% include image_with_caption.html url="/assets/images/norway/ryten.png" caption="Ryten summit." %}

Day 3 we do Justadtinden, a longer hike with a more gradual incline but nevertheless a stunning 360
summit view. Along the way we meet a cool backpacker and have fun walking across frozen lakes.
That night we cook tomato soup and grilled cheese for dinner, and because it's the last night also buy
some ice cream and warm cookies for dessert. Oh, and we randomly watch Leo's new documentary "Before
The Flood."

# Back In Oslo

Bharath and I say our goodbyes to Amanda and hop on a flight back to Oslo. We make it back to the nation's
capital for its first snow of the season, do some last minute shopping, and check out the Oslo World Music
Festival with a coworker and his cousin at night. The next morning we take the NSB back to the airport, LAX bound.

It's been a long but fun two weeks in Scandanavia, and we're both ready to shed a few layers for a while.
