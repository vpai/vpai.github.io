It's nearly here — in just a few weeks I'll be hopping on a bicycle and pedaling over
3800 miles across North America (!). I'll be 1 of 32 humans riding from Portland, Maine west
to Santa Barbara, California over the course of 2.5 months along the following route:

We're doing this ride through an organization called [Bike & Build](http://bikeandbuild.org/).
Its purpose is to bring together young people from across the country and engage them in a summer
dedicated to benefiting *affordable housing* via annual bike journeys across the US. Learn more
about B&B below:

For me this trip has been in the works since December. Since applying and being accepted on the ride
late last year, I've been busy fundraising, training, and completing a mini affordable housing 101
course that are all prerequisites to participate, all while working a full time job. Slightly complicating
things was the fact that earlier in the year I had moved out of San Francisco and relocated to
Singapore for 3 months. Safe to say it's been a hectic past few months.

But worth it! I'm unbelievably thrilled for this trip, as it will undoubtedly be a mental and physical
grind. I think my body is in for a shock the first few days that we average 60-70 miles. Along
the way rain, scorching heat, bruises, blisters, falls, and flat tires are all guaranteed. Grit will
be essential.

I really enjoy biking, and feel like the past few months have really helped me level ⬆️ my
biking game. Till now I'd call myself a pretty casual biker (commute plus longer rides here and there),
but over the the past few months I've learned a lot about bike gear, maintenance, and repair while
having ridden much farther distances. One of the most exciting purchases for me was clipless pedals,
which for me have always been a symbol of a certain legitness on the road:

I'm also excited about the community component of the trip. I don't know a single person that I'll
be spending the next few months with, which, rather than fear, incites in me that same rush you get
on day 1 of summer camp or at a new school. This will be a chance to spend time with a self-selecting
group of individuals who are all outside my existing network/city and probably have widely different
world views than me. We share a spirit of adventure and a certain penchant for service, and simply
based on that commonality I'm really looking forward to building strong relationships with my fellow
ME2SB riders.

And then there's the cause. What is affordable housing? A definition: housing is considered
"<u>affordable</u>" to a low-income family as long as the cost of the housing, including rent or
mortgage/tax payments plus basic utilities minus telephone and internet service, does not exceed
30% (before taxes) of the familiy's income. A <u>low-income family</u> is defined as one whose
annual income does not exceed 80% of the median income for the area as calculated by the Federal
Government.

The issue of affordable housing is especially pronounced in SF, but it's one of those problems so far ranging
that it can be hard to grasp and act upon. It's a symptom of poverty, but is more concrete in that it
is about a [fundamental human need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), the home.
Beyond a place to sleep, a home is where meals are prepared and cherished, children are raised, friendships
made, books read, and communities formed. The intangible benefits are countless. This trip is
going provide a much wider lens on a plight faced by a wide range of Americans, not just those living
in dense urban centers. I'm looking forward to engaging with folks in the towns and cities we pass through,
and to be offering whatever we can to their communities.

T-minus 27 days till we get going. Before then I'm hoping to set up another page that will overlay
my photos on a map as I progress along the route.

Lastly, anyone wishing to help me can do so [here](http://classic.bikeandbuild.org/cms/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,118/?item_name_1=8758). I'm about
75% through my fundraising goal but still need a little push in order to reach the $4500 I need.
