You’re been hired as an engineer at a company you love. The team is relatively small and the words “full stack” got you excited when you spoke to the recruiter. You feel lucky, and wonder how crazy it is that life can change so fast so quickly. It’s a realization you never want to forget. Just a few weeks ago you were deep in the stress of the job hunt. Now you're on cloud nine.

Your role feels dynamic — on Monday you’re building a new user interface and on Thursday you’re helping keep the site up. You’re here to write code — type a sequence of characters that few others at your company can — but you feel proud that your job is more than that. You were hired because of your love for crafting delightful products, for your ability to help bring life to something that make other people’s lives better. In the hiring panel there was a 45 minute slot slated for someone to assess these “product” skills. Questions ranged from “what are your favorite products in the world? why?” to “how would you change this flow of ours?”. There was a satisfying human component to this work, a creative balance to the logic and focus needed to code, that got you up every morning. You feel light.

A year passes, and you’ve passed the honeymoon phase. The company continues to do well, and by necessity structure has been introduced to the team. Individual and manager career tracks are laid out — it becomes clear what you have to do to rise. The team has doubled, but you still find comfort in knowing everyone by name. You switch teams in order to get a flavor of another part of the business. The work is fresh, there is so much to be done. You love your coworkers and feel proud about the products being pushed out.

Yet another year passes, and an opportunity arises to be grow a new business vertical from scratch. “Bootstrapping” is what they call it. You jump on the chance after chatting with your manager. After all, you love making products. For a few months it’s a small team of 3. Seeing the metrics jump week over week, even on a tiny scale, is incredibly rewarding. The larger team has again doubled, and it’s now impractical to know everyone’s name. It’s okay though — you’re in a small bubble that feels right. You’re energized and growing.

Not before long it’s been three years since you joined the company. Where has time gone? The product you helped bootstrap last year has been successful and is well on its way to hitting prime time. The larger team has yet again doubled, but something about this particular expansion doesn’t feel like the growth in years past. The organizational hierarchy feels tall. Your old manager is suddenly a few levels above you. There are on-stage Q&As with people who you sat next to in your earlier days. You feel like mountains are being moved above you. You hear talk of people getting “layered”. Huge decisions are made by recent hires in high level positions. “Directors” are suddenly a thing. You start to feel invisible.

On your immediate team, you feel stuck between two immovable forces. Above you, you have product managers, dictating the direction of your team and indirectly controlling your schedule and time. Below, you have a fast moving, ever-changing infrastructure. The “taxes” paid to contribute code to the product have exponentially increased over the years. Of course, these measures exist for the good of the team, ensuring reliability and consistency. But on this Monday you’re writing your feature, and two Mondays later, the same feature.

You came here to build delightful products, but you feel like that’s not what you’re doing anymore. The word "craft" does not resonate with the work you're doing. Among a few products you're involved in, details are missed, communication is weak, standards are sloppy. The role you once occupied — a jack of many trades, master of none – is not as valued as it once was. The 45 minute interview testing "product" skills was sytemically removed a while ago. Job postings for your company are increasingly specialized: “front-end”, “ML”, “security”. You feel the need to comform, to specialize, in order to be valued, to be recognized, to grow. The career paths laid out two years ago never motivated you in the first place.

Writing code has become a chore. It’s easy and mundane, but it takes a long time. This is not how you want to spend your time. The human component of your job, the part you cherished the most three years ago, is gone. You don’t feel like you mesh with your team. You start to feel isolated.

You take a big breath and step back. This is the moment of maturity needed to realize what you can control and what you can't. You realize these are amazing problems to have. You work at a company you admire and love with people you work with. The company is doing well. The team growth is a sign of good things for everybody. There are massive amounts of external validation signaling that this is the right place to be. But still, an unsettling feeling lingers. Maybe this is no longer for you. You feel heavy.

You start thinking strategy. You want to control your destiny. What you’ve always loved about your company is that if you want to drive something, you can. There is always someone to support you. So you think, how to change? What step to take next?

You consider other roles internally, reaching out to your network of friends and colleagues around the company. You uncover a few compelling opportunities, including a few one-off openings that would both sharpen your existing skills and force you to grow in new ways.

You spend weeks considering these opportunities. You write out a pros/cons chart. Factors include creativity, autonomy, and growth, but the most important question is: “am I ready to give this my 110%?”.

It’s been three and a half years, and you feel like the answer to the most important question is no. You decide to opt out. It’s time to start fresh.

The Sunday after you submit your resignation, a week before your last day, you’re hit with emotion. You run through the day pretending as though it’s the first morning of unemployment, a trial run. This place has become a core part of your identity. A sadness sets in.

In your last week, you say your goodbyes. Mailing lists that you once felt comfortable sending mail to are now composed of many hundreds of people — far too big for a goodbye email. Instead, you hand pick people who you feel close to. You look back and feel immense gratitude on all the experiences you’ve had, friendships you’ve made.

It’s Monday morning, the first weekday after. Some sadness remains, but after a visit to the gym, an old feeling visits. It’s the feeling you had when you first joined the company. It’s the acute emotion you had wanted to remember. The possibility of how life can change so fast so quickly. Well, you remember. Suddenly, your world seems full of opportunity. The pep is back in your step, and you realize it’s the greatest time to be alive.
