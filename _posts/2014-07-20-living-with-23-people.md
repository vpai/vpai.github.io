Last month I started a new and exciting chapter in life. I now live in an intentional community with 23 other people (plus Nikon, our furry friend) near the center of San Francisco. I’ve been a part of many different types of communities throughout my upbringing and early adult life, but none quite like this.

It’s not often that life changes this much this fast, so I thought I would take some time to write about it. In this post I’ll describe why and how I made the transition into this community, the space itself, and what this new style of living has been like over the past few weeks.

Like several of my fellow UC Berkeley graduates, I moved across the Bay to San Francisco last summer after a couple months of post-college travel. Along with two college buddies (S and A), I settled into a 3 bedroom loft in SOMA only a few blocks from my work.

Fast forward to this May, and after a year in that apartment, it was time to decide whether to renew our lease or find something new. I decided on the latter for a handful of reasons:
Work was too close to home. It felt as bad as being too far. The two had become one, and among other things, this meant that I would stay at the office later. 90% of my life was spent within a 5 block radius, and that wasn’t healthy.

Rent was going up. Not by an insane amount, but this was still a factor.
Safety. The part of SOMA we were in wasn’t exactly the most pleasant place to be. I would be lying if I said there weren’t times that I was scared walking home late at night from the Mission. The first time my parents and sister had come to visit me for raksha bandhan, our family’s SUV had been smashed into just outside the building.

It felt like time for something different. I’ve lived in the Bay Area for 20 years now, and I’m not sure how much longer I’m going to be here. I remember a coworker mentioning to me once how he had lived in over 5 different neighborhoods after only a few short years of living in SF, and I thought that was the coolest thing. Nomadic living sounded great. I wanted to experience each nook that SF had to offer before moving elsewhere.

The decision to move meant I had to find a new place by June 1st or be homeless because S and A had already found a new place. I started browsing the ‘rooms/shared’ section of Craigslist on a daily basis, looking for single occupancy openings. I enumerated a list of things I was looking for. Among them, a large common living space, a yard, and a park nearby. More than anything, what I really sought was a home.

After a day or two, I stumbled across a listing for a home called Le Chateau McAlamo (henceforth referred to as LCA). The post contained pictures of the space and mini blurbs about each of the residents. It also linked me to the house’s website. The people seemed motivated, thoughtful, fun, and family-oriented. I decided to apply — why not? I figured I had no shot. This was sure to be a dead end.
I took the next couple days to fill out the written application, and was thrilled when I got an email from S, one of the founders of the house, asking to meet up. A few days later it was official, and the next thing I knew I was hauling all my belongings up the stairs of LCA.

## The Home

LCA is located across the street from Alamo Square Park, a half block away from San Francisco’s iconic Painted Ladies.

The community occupies two independent units in a four unit building, each unit taking up an entire floor. The units are connected via an outdoor staircase, and whole building shares a common backyard and a roof that overlooks the city.

In total, there are 24 individuals including myself split between these two units. Nobody has their own room — some rooms contain as few as 2 people, and some as many as 4 (two bunks). I share a room with M, a rising senior at the University of Viriginia. He’s a pretty amazing dude.
Sharing a room was one of the biggest changes of this transition. Many people tell me there’s no way they could do it. I was concerned at first, but it actually doesn’t bother me at all. It makes me feel like a kid again. Shoot, I am a kid. The minor inconveniences are well worth it.
In addition to the rooms, there are several shared spaces between the two units. The backyard and roof I already mentioned. We are also fortunate to have two fully stocked state-of-the-art kitchens, two living areas, and a cozy fireplace.

## The Community

The McAlamo family is diverse on many dimensions. The age range here spans from 20 years old to over 40. We’re representatives from Canada, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Spain, Iran, India, Singapore, and the US all under one roof. People enjoy and have made careers around all sorts of things, including rock climbing, yoga, biking, cooking, writing, fitness, software and photography.
What unites the group is a shared commitment to community, a vision that’s bigger than any individual. We value paying it forward, being mindful and aware, looking after one another, collaboration, and being active members of the external community and city. Together these ideas make up the intention in the word intentional. They create positive energy. They are why this type of living situation doesn’t turn to chaos on day 2. For most, these values are implicitly understood and visible through action.
Evenings are my favorite. On a typical weeknight, I’ll come back home to lively scene. A few people will be socializing, some will be watching GOT re-runs, some will be relaxing in the backyard, and inevitably some will be preparing a meal.

Food is a big deal at LCA, and family dinners are a common thing. Meals bring people together. Cooking is a team sport. It becomes easy and low stress when work the is split, the ingredients are fresh, the food is good, and when there are people to clean up. For me there are also few things more rewarding than seeing others cherish a meal I’ve prepared.

Every month, all of us contribute to a shared pool of money that’s used towards common expenses including food. Most things are bought in bulk to minimize costs. At any given time the fridge is loaded with fresh produce, eggs, dairy, and meat. K, another housemate, also visits the farmer’s market biweekly and brings back boxes upon boxes of the best local fruit.

None of this happens magically. We have a leadership team that manages a ton of logistics behind the scenes. We have house meetings twice a month to coordinate plans, express gratitude, and voice concerns. We’re also the in the process of the defining roles and point people for various needs. For example, AK manages facilities, AR manages gardening, and AA manages recruiting. The community is a better place when everyone contributes.

## The Future

Intentional communities were never on my radar until I started living in one. There are quite a few similar efforts in SF, many focused on tech:
The Embassy Network: http://embassynetwork.com/
Campus: http://buildcampus.com/
TheGlint: http://theglint.com/
Lots more listed here: http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tech-entrepreneurs-revive-communal-living-4988388.php

Though coliving isn’t big in the U.S yet, I think it’s on its way there, especially with the flux of more and more people (especially young people) into big cities. Like Airbnb, the concept isn’t new. People used to live like this. They still do in many other parts of the world. In India, for example, it’s common for 3 or more generations of joint families to live together in a single household. It’s how my Dad grew up for large parts of his childhood. That’s what LCA reminds me of. It’s the same, just without the blood relation. Trust is built in.
Apart from the fun, living here has been an incredible learning experience for me. It’s made me more humble, understanding, and empathetic. It’s made me realize that community is one of the things I value most. It’s opened my eyes up to new perspectives and people in different stages of their lives, some of whom I would have ever otherwise crossed paths with. It’s augmented my world view for the better.

What’s most exciting is that this is just the beginning. There’s still a lot to do, a lot to build, a lot to share, and I’m really looking forward to it.
